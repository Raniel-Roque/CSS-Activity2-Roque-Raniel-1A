Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening Sir

I just wanted to say that i wasnt sure about the hovering color change of read more if it applied to all 4 or only "Post Title 3" and so was the hovering shadow for the services parts. I have applied both the read more color change and the hover shadow to all their corresponding elements rather than just one.
